# DFT

This is a course project of DSP, Year 3, UESTC & Glasgow Joint School.

Simulate the DFT procedures:

1. Set up sampling frequency
2. Anti-aliasing filter
3. ADC, sampling interval
4. Windowing
5. DFT

The input signal is
$$
x(t)=10sin(2\pi64t)+sin(2\pi250t)+20sin(2\pi256t)+3sin(2\pi260t)+10sin(2\pi512t)
$$
The sampling period is 1026Hz.

DFT-point is 513.

Types of windows: Rectangular, Hann, Bartlett, Hamming, Blackman.
